export const ABOUT_ME =
  "Passionately irrational about Mathematics and Philosophy - especially when Euler drops identities and Ramanujan casually writes formulas from another dimension. Anime keeps my complex numbers in check. I'm at B2 in English, almost 日本語能力試験N5 (JLPT N5) in Japanese - basically trilingual if you count LaTeX. Currently studying Database Systems at PUCRS, serving as a Statistics TA, and optimizing my path to becoming an OBM gold medalist (proof pending)."
